\section*{Abstract}

Pixhawk is an embedded autopilot project with a tremendous market potential. This Product had just been upgraded to a new version. A flight controller has to run stable under any circumstances. Malfunctioning may cause severe damage to the aircraft and its surroundings. The main objective for this paper is to compare and implement a hardware in the loop test bench for such product. Utilizing this procedure, several test cases can be executed without the risk of damage. Also, a Simulink plugin was reviewed for stated requirements. However, that  expansion was unable to fulfill the specificaion and therefore not persued. Thus, a different approach was  evaluated. The source code for the Pixhawk firmware was altered to integrate a feasibility to access the internal data such as sensor values or actuating variables. Moreover, an enviroment simulation was designed with Matlab/Simulink to be run on a host PC. This paper offers a slim, expandable, reuasable hardware in the loop solution for Pixhawk.
